    "A user can write plugins to openfermion which allow for the use of, e.g., third-party electronic structure package to compute molecular orbitals, Hamiltonians, energies, reduced density matrices, coupled cluster amplitudes, etc using Gaussian basis sets. We may provide scripts which interface between such packages and openfermion in future but do not discuss them in this tutorial.\n",

    "When using simpler basis sets such as plane waves, these packages are not needed. openfermion comes with code which computes Hamiltonians in the plane wave basis. Note that when using plane waves, one is working with the periodized Coulomb operator, best suited for condensed phase calculations such as studying the electronic structure of a solid. To obtain these Hamiltonians one must choose to study the system without a spin degree of freedom (spinless), one must the specify dimension in which the calculation is performed (n_dimensions, usually 3), one must specify how many plane waves are in each dimension (grid_length) and one must specify the length scale of the plane wave harmonics in each dimension (length_scale) and also the locations and charges of the nuclei. One can generate these models with plane_wave_hamiltonian() found in openfermion.hamiltonians. For simplicity, below we compute the Hamiltonian in the case of zero external charge (corresponding to the uniform electron gas, aka jellium). We also demonstrate that one can transform the plane wave Hamiltonian using a Fourier transform without effecting the spectrum of the operator."
